name="Documentation Comment Helper"
description="A plugin that provides slightly easier ways to insert documentation comments.
Without the plugin, documentation comments have to be prefixed with ##, for which there is no shortcut key.
This plugin gives you a right-click option in the script editor to convert highlighted lines to documentation comments, or to open a window wherein you can type up a documentation comment and then copy it into your script."
