A relatively simple plugin for Godot 4.x that adds features to make creating documentation comments (those that start with ## ) a little more streamlined.

This plugin adds a context menu item to the script editor titled ## Documentation, and under that you may either convert any lines currently selected in your code to documentation code (prefix them with ## ) or open a window to type your documentation comments into before converting them and copying them to the clipboard.

Thanks all.
